This repository contains the sourcecode of Distrochooser from
[distrochooser.de](http://distrochooser.de) for developing purposes.

> Under development warning: I'm currently still chaning a lot of features of the software. 
I'm open to contributions and/ or suggestions. The sourcecode has still some flaws, for example.

Please note: This repository only contains the script part itself, the backend part is stored in different repositories.

Third party things, for example Logos of the several distributions and the database, are not included.
