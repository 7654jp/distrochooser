##Distrochooser 2 Source Mirror
###What ist the Distrochooser?
> The Distrochooser is a service for beginners to find a suitable Linux distribution. Every result of the distrochooser is only a suggestion and should help the user to get an orientation.
###Where is the database?
> Only the source itself is open source. The database not. I want to prevent that there are many instances of this tool with different database versions giving completely different results. If you want to help contribute changes via pull requests here and I will merge it (if possible) to the main version on distrochooser.0fury.de or distrochooser.de. I hope you can understand it.
