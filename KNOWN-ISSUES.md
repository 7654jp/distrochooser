### **Issues Identified:**

1. **Slider Visibility Issue**:
   - In the "Linux and You" and "Computer Knowledge" sections, the weight slider appears only next to the first question, but in other sections, the slider is displayed next to every question.
   
   **Expected Behavior**: The weight slider should appear next to all questions consistently across all sections.

2. **Non-Functional Plus/Minus Buttons**:
   - The plus (+) and minus (-) buttons next to the weight sliders do not function. Clicking them does not adjust the slider values.
   
   **Expected Behavior**: The plus/minus buttons should adjust the slider values when clicked.

3. **Improperly Formatted Results**:
   - The results at the end are not well-formatted and difficult to understand. The layout needs improvement for better clarity.

   **Expected Behavior**: The results page should be clearly formatted, making it easy to interpret the suggested distributions.

4. **Missing "Skip Question" Button**:
   - There is no "Skip Question" button, which limits user flexibility while filling out the form.
   
   **Expected Behavior**: A "Skip Question" button should be available to allow users to skip certain questions if needed.

5. **Repeated Alerts in Distribution Privacy Section**
Alerts for the same action appear multiple times.
