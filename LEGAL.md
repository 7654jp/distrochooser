##Legal information

This part of the distrochooser is MIT licensed with no other restrictions. 
But be fair. It's not my intention to offer a cheap possibility to copy this service and host a clone of it.

Thats the reason why there is no database dump.

Invest your energy instead to help to make the original distrochooser better. Leave an issue or open a pull request. Thanks.
