# Contributing to the distrochooser project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the distrochooser project 🎉!

# General

Distrochooser has a very slow development cycle as this is a "weekend warrior" project. This means that issues might be unanswered for months before being picked up. But don't worry, they will be discussed, but just not that fast as in large projects. 

Please note that there will be no discussions with deleted accounts (on PR/ Issues/ Discussions). These threads will be closed.

> Please inform me when you plan to contribute (e. g. in the discussion tab or in an issue), so I can introduce you to caveats/issues and give you hints on how to realize your contribution in the best possible way. Thank you!
