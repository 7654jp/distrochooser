Supercedes [0005. i18n (Gettext)](0005-i18n.md)

## Context

Django offers a Translation module, which shall be used. The previous approach using the onboard tools was identified as not suitable for the project context, due to:

- The po files are tricky to handle to to it's line-related structure
- Flat files might be easier to utilzes, such as plain text or JSON, especially from a frontend perspective.

## Decision

Implementation of a JSON based translation approach, the project received it's own translation approach, implemented with the `Translatable` base class and it's `TranslateableField`. 
While the fields exist in the database, the translation values are read from the `locale` (as `LOCALE_PATH[0]`) path as JSON files. The files consist out of a plain dictionary.

## Consequences

The JSON files lack a descriptive text, might cause issues for users at translation without having a proper context.
