# Architecture

We are using https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools here to show architectural decisions in a lightweight way.

# Tooling

To add a new decision, use `adr new <what happened>`

To generate the HTML file `decisions.html`, use `adr-viewer --adr-path doc/architecture/decisions --output doc/architecture/decisions.html`
